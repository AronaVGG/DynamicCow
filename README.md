## Troubleshoot
The app now have a Troubleshoot section to restore the plist file, but if you want you can also use [this shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4920/).

The shortcut will "reset" the plist file to an initial state solving any kind of problem.

### How to use the shortcut
1. Simply start it and wait for a drop-down menu to appear. 
2. Then click on "View it in Quick View".
3. You should see some writing, if the file is empty restart the shortcut.

## Note
- iOS 15/14/13 are **NOT** and will never be supported, as this is **NOT** a tweak.
If you have one of the above listed iOS versions, please stay away from it cause it can bootloop your device.

- I deleted the issue section because of meaningless spam of some users.

- I will keep you updated on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aboutzeph) and on this readme about new features and bug fixes.
