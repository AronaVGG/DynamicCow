## Know Issues
> no fix at the moment.
- In some devices (iPhone 11) along with Dynamic Island a red bar is displayed with a rdar error.

---

> will be solved
- If you fuck up manually the com.apple.MobileGestalt.plist the app will crash when you try to enable / disable the Dynamic Island.

## Troubleshoot
At the moment the app does not have a troubleshoot section but I will implement it in the future, so it can repair the fucked up plist.

For now I recommend using [this shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/4920/).

The shortcut will "reset" the plist file to an initial state solving any kind of problem.

### How to use the shortcut
1. Simply start it and wait for a drop-down menu to appear. 
2. Then click on "View it in Quick View".
3. You should see some writing, if the file is empty restart the shortcut.

## Note
- iOS 15/14/13 are **NOT** and will never be supported, as this is **NOT** a tweak.
If you have one of the above listed iOS versions, please stay away from it cause it can bootloop your device.

- I deleted the issue section because of meaningless spam of some users.

- I will keep you updated on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aboutzeph) and on this readme about new features and bug fixes.
